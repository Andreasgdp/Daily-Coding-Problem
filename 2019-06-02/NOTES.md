# Notes (2019-06-02)

1. The ```for-loop``` runs through all the elements of the list of strings.
2. Here it checks for each string if the sting (each string is only one word) starts with the prefix ```s```.
3. If the string does start with that prefix, then it is added to a list of all strings, that start with that prefix.

Both prefix and strings must not contain any white spaces for the program to work every time.
