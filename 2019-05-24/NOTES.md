# Notes (2019-05-24)

1.  This part loops through the list of integers, to get their values.

2.  This part loops through the list of integers once more for each of the integers in the list, so that the values of the two loops can be compared and for the same numbers to be excluded. 

3. This part is comparing the values of each number in the first loop to the values in the second loop to exclude matching numbers.
